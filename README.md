# Plast Mem

Experimental Memory Layer designed for Waifu / Companion / Assistant

## About (from @kwaa)

This is my third attempt at a memory layer; the first two failed.

For this implementation, I've decided to build it publicly, hoping that interested people (like you, perhaps?) might join in.

At present, it is still far from being basically usable.

### Status

I plan to first write a minimal implementation referred on SimpleMem and Nemori, then build upon it with improvements.

During the `v0.0.x` stage, backward compatibility is not guaranteed at all.
